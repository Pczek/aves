How I stay up-to-date as a Developer

I can hardly imagine any other industry that is so dynamic and inviting as software development. I mean, imagine your young-self, dreaming to be the best heart surgeon in the world? You’ll have to study 11 to 13 years after high school before you can actually perform an unassisted surgery. What if you want to be a chemistry Nobel winner? There’s no way you can just build a lab in your garage and start practicing (or at least it’s very unlikely)

This is not true for developers.
